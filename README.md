elpa-audit.el
=============

This library provides functions for inspecting and comparing package
archives, and is largely for the convenience of package archive
maintainers such as the author!

Installation
=============

If you choose not to use one of the convenient packages
in [MELPA][melpa], you'll need to add the directory containing
`elpa-audit.el` to your `load-path`, and then `(require 'elpa-audit)`.

Usage
=====

See `elpa-audit.el` for available functions.
